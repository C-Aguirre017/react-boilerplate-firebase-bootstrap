# react-boilerplate-firebase-bootstrap
React/Redux App with Firebase and Bootstrap Integration

### Installation
To install run ```npm install```.

### Running dev server with hot reloading
To start the webpack devserver with hot reloading run ```npm run dev```

### Configure firebase
Navigate to the ```firebase``` directory.  You'll see two files in there, one for development and one for production.  You will need to obtain your firebase information from your firebase console and input that information here.  I keep a separate dev & production database, but if you're just playing around with it, it doesn't matter.
